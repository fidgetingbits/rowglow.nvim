# RowGlow

RowGlow aims to make the modulo 100 part of absolute row numbers easier to identify in neovim. This is a problem
encountered when using voice coding plugins like cursorless, which only allow targeting absolute rows between 00 and
99. RowGlow also allows simultaneous absolute and relative number columns, allowing the user to tweak the colors to
allow quick targeting by voice.

Is entirely possible that this would be more suited to just the call back to something like statuscolumn.nvim, but for
now I want something easily shared with other voice users.
